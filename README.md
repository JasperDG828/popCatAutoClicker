# POPCAT AUTOCLICKER

<u>By JasperDG</u>

### DEPENDENCIES:

 - Python 3.x
 - Pynput module (install using "pip install pynput")
 - Time module (should be installed by default with python)

### USAGE: 

(Steps 1 - 5 are focused on installing python, the dependencies and the autoclicker)

 1) Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python
 2) Run the executable to install python
 3) You can test your python installation by opening the command-prompt(win+r, cmd, enter)
     and typing `python --version` (or `python3 --version`, depending on the exact installation)
 4) To install the pynput module, use `pip install pynput` or `pip3 install pynput`
 5) To download the files for this autoclicker, just click "Download ZIP" on the github page, under the green button "Code".
     Then unzip the file and you have the needed files.
 6) Alternative to download the files: use `git clone http://github.com/JasperDG828/popcatAutoClicker.git` (only available when you have git installed)

Python and the dependencies should be set up

 7) Open the main.py file in a terminal using `python main.py`(or python3 depending on your configuration)
 8) The script will ask for a clickDelay, the recommended setting is 0.05
 9) Quickly open popcat on [https://popcat.click/](https://popcat.click/)
 10) Within 5 seconds of entering the delay, the script will start clicking for you.
 11) To quit the autoclicker, press ctrl in the terminal window. You'll receive an error, but that's normal.

I hope you can enjoy this autoclicker!
