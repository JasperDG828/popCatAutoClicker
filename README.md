<u>By JasperDG</u>

### DEPENDENCIES:

 - Python 3.x
 - Pynput module (install using "pip install pynput")
 - Time module (should be installed by default with python)

### USAGE: 

(The roman numerals represent steps for setting up python, installing dependencies and downloading the codes)

I  ) Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python
II ) Run the executable to install python
III) You can test your python installation by opening the command-prompt(win+r, cmd, enter)
     and typing `python --version` (or `python3 --version`, depending on the exact installation)
IV ) To install the pynput module, use `pip install pynput` or `pip3 install pynput`,
V  ) To download the files for this autoclicker, just click "Download ZIP" on the github page, under the green button "Code".
     Then unzip the file and you have the needed files.
V  ) Alternative to download the files: use `git clone http://github.com/JasperDG828/popcatAutoClicker.git` (only available when you have git installed)

Python and the dependencies should be set up

1) Open the main.py file in a terminal using `python main.py`(or python3 depending on your configuration)
2) Quickly open popcat on [https://popcat.click/](https://popcat.click/)
3) Within 5 seconds of starting the script, it will start clicking for you.
4) To quit the autoclicker, press ctrl in the terminal window. You'll receive an error, but that's normal.

I hope you can enjoy this autoclicker!
